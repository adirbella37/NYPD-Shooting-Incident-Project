## 📈 Key Insights
- Contrary to expectations, shooting incidents are almost evenly split between day and night.  
- Incident rates rise steadily at the beginning of the year, peak in July, and then decline — likely due to targeted police intervention in Brooklyn.  
- Surprisingly, around 70% of outdoor incidents involve older age groups, despite the assumption that they would exercise more discretion.
